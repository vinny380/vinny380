# Vin√≠cius Porfirio Purgato
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

I am 17 years old and a new Data Scientist building my career through projects and by generating valuable content to the people who follow me in the internet.
My plans are to become a better Data Scientist and to generate more value to people, I'm also interested in Bioinformatics, Astronomy and Aerospace Engineering, and probably one them might be my area of undergrad. I am still learning what I like or not with Python.
**Background in:** Python, G Suite and Data Science.
